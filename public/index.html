            First thing's first, let's go over how this works. You'll see an embedded website on this page. That's called an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe">iframe</a>. That's the vulnerable site you're going to be attacking. The iframe is the registration page. Just like the one we used in class. The HTML you see below is for the Profile page we used in class. This site will allow you to type into the registration input fields and see the affect you'll have on the corresponding Profile page as you're typing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Go ahead and type into the username field and you'll see the html change as you type. Hopefully, this will make understanding XSS injections easier. You can see exactly how your input will modify the resulting html.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recall that the server uses template strings to dynamically generate the HTML page. So <span class='code'>${user.username}</span class='code'> and <span class='code'>${user.email}</span class='code'> are going to be the username and email that are retrieved from the server's datastore. Which come from the username and email address the user enters in the registration form. This is your window into a XSS injection. You control the input which means you have control over the resulting HTML. It's as if the website's programmer is letting you type the HTML straight in their text editor. So we'll see how we can exploit that and how we can defend against it.
